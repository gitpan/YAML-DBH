INSTALLATION

   tar -xvf ./$this_package_file
   cd $package_dir_created
   perl Makefile.PL
   make test
   make install

TESTING

For real testing you will need to have a running mysqld server.
You need to be able to make a connection to a database with these parameters:

   username: testing
   database: testing
   password: testing
   hostname: localhost

If you do have this set up, run 

   perl t/01_find_confs_and_test.pl

If you want to set up your own parameters, throw in a bunch of 
config files in t/ that you know will work.
Each file must end in '.conf'.
