YAML::DBH
=========

Point and shoot method of getting a database handle with only a yaml 
configuration file as argument. 

This is meant for people learning perl who just want to get up and running.
It's the simplest customizable way of getting a database handle with very little code.

This is mostly for mysql- the default driver used. The conf file may also tell to 
use a sqlite db instead.



INSTALLATION

   tar -xvf ./$this_package_file
   cd $package_dir_created
   perl Makefile.PL
   make test
   make install

TESTING

For real testing you will need to have a running mysqld server.

You need to be able to make a connection to a database as per 

./t/mysql_credentials.conf

   username: testing
   database: testing
   password: testing
   hostname: localhost

If you do have this set up, run 

   perl t/01_find_confs_and_test.pl

If you want to set up your own parameters, throw in a bunch of 
config files in t/ that you know will work.
Each file must end in '.conf'.
