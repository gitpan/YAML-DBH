	* lib/YAML/DBH.pm, t/03-sqlite.t: added ability to open sqlite db
	  instead of mysql, this makes it easier to roll out tests etc..
	  using a sqlite db for the super lazy/convenient

	* lib/YAML/DBH.pm, t/02_open_from_confhash.t: Added capacity for
	  yaml_dbh() to take a conf hashref to scan, instead of just a path
	  to a conf file.

	  So that, if you already have a conf opened, you can pass that
	  instead to yaml_dbh() to get your dbh.
